    I’m a bilingual first-grade teacher with five years of classroom experience, and I feel grateful to be serving students in the same community where I grew up. It’s surreal to now be teaching in the very district where I was once a student—the roles have truly reversed! In my free time, I enjoy going on walks, watching movies, and trying out new restaurants. I’m also excited about this class and look forward to developing my coding skills.

    Before teaching, I worked as a Circulation Clerk at a public library. I worked closely with customers of all ages and backgrounds. I provided customers with the best customer service and constantly strived to ensure the library's values were reflected through my actions. I loved the environment at the library where I worked as the staff members were supportive and encouraged me to come out of my shell more. This “job” eventually became a second home to me, and am now pursuing it as a “career”.
