      I’m a bilingual first-grade teacher with five years of classroom experience, and I feel grateful to be serving students in the same community where I grew up. It’s surreal to now be teaching in the very district where I was once a student—the roles have truly reversed! In my free time, I enjoy going on walks, watching movies, and trying out new restaurants. I’m also excited about this class and look forward to developing my coding skills.
