                I am a bilingual first-grade teacher with five years of classroom 
                experience, and I feel grateful to be serving students in the same 
                community where I grew up.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy going on walks, watching movies, and 
                trying out new restaurants. I love spending time with my dog!
            </p>

            <p>
                Before teaching, I worked as a Circulation Clerk at a public library.
                I worked closely with customers of all ages and backgrounds. I provided customers with the best 
                customer service and constantly strived to ensure the library's values were reflected through my actions. 
                I loved the environment at the library where I worked as the staff members were supportive and encouraged me to come out of my shell more. 
                This “job” eventually became a second home to me, and am now pursuing it as a “career”.
            </p>
