                I am a bilingual first-grade teacher with five years of classroom experience, and I feel grateful to be serving students in the same community where I grew up. Teaching in the district where I was once a student feels surrealâ€”the roles have truly reversed!

                In my free time, I enjoy going on walks, watching movies, and trying out new restaurants. I love spending time with my dog. I am also excited about this class and look forward to developing my coding skills.

                Before teaching, I worked as a Circulation Clerk at a public library. I worked closely with customers of all ages and backgrounds, providing excellent service and striving to reflect the library's values through my actions. The environment was supportive, encouraging me to come out of my shell more. This job eventually became a second home to me, and I am now pursuing teaching as a career.
